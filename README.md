# cpp_pointers
An exercise to explore pointers in C++

1. Declare a variable "a" and initialize it with any value. Then create a pointer variable "p" containing the address of the variable "a". Print out in the console the value and address of the variable "a" using both variable "a" and pointer "p".
2. Create another pointer "pp" containing the address  of the pointer variable "p". Print out in the console the value and address of the variable "a" using variable "a" and pointers "p" and "pp". Print out the value and address of the pointer "p" using pointers "p" and "pp".
3. Declare 5 element array of integers and a pointer to the first element of the array. Use the pointer and its incrementation instead of array notation, fill the array with any integer numbers. Print all of the elements out in the console.
